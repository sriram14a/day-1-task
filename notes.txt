Authentication Mechanism                   It is relatively secure since it             Security concerns from previous
                                           uses digest authentication,                  versions will continue to be seen

Status Code                                Introduces a warning header                  Underlying semantics of HTTP
                                           field to carry additional                    such as headers, status codes

                                           quicker and more efficient.                        

Caching                                    Expands on the caching                       HTTP/2 does not change much in
                                           support by using additional                  terms of caching. With the server
                                           headers like cache-control,                  push feature if the client finds the

                                           Match and by using entity tags.              the cache, it can cancel the

Web Traffic                                HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery            HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and    
                                           of web pages and reduces web traffic         server push to effectively
                                           as compared to HTTP/1.0. However,            reduce the page load time by
                                           TCP starts slowly and with domain            a greater margin along with being
                                           sharding (resources can be downloaded        less sensitive to network delays.
                                           simultaneously by using multiple
                                           domains),connection reuse                                                                                        
                                           and pipelining, there is an increased 
                                           risk of network congestion.
